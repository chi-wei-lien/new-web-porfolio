# My Portfolio Website!

This is the forth time I rebuilt my portfolio website. This time, I created a backend that helps me render all my journals to the frontend. I also followed the rest API structure while hosting my frontend on Netlify and backend on Heroku. For the details on how I built it please refer to the "Techonology Involved" section.

## Techonology Involved

This project is created with the MERN([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/), [React JS](https://reactjs.org/), [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/)) structure + [Typescrpit](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). As mentioned, the frontend is hosted with Netlify and the backend is hosted with Heroku. [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) is used to connect the backend and frontend.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
